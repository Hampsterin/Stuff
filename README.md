# Stuff
#About

All of the codes here are from group assignments where the codes are originally committed into my friend's repository (private), so I have essentially made a copy of them in pasted them here so that it is accessible but I would say I still have a lot to learn for php and JavaScript. On a side note, Java is not included in this repository since our assignment is tailored towards coding / designing using JFrame. ฅ՞•ﻌ•՞ฅ
# WDT
local-host (Committed into my friend's repository since she was the leader)
# SDP
One of my friend set up the API so that codes can be run on a live server, which we all just committed the codes into his repository since he's managing the server and the backend codes (5 of us in total)
